# 30 Days of Power BI

This repository contains my 30-day Power BI learning journey.

## What’s here

- Day 1–Day 15 practice files (Superstore dataset)
- Row-Level Security setup (Central, East, West Manager roles)
- Governance setup (workspace, endorsement, discoverability)

## Day 15 – Governance Setup

- Created a dedicated workspace **Day15_Governance**
- Published Superstore shared dataset and report into this workspace
- Configured **Row-Level Security** for:
  - Central Manager
  - East Manager
  - West Manager
- Tested each role in Power BI Service (“View as role”)
- Set **Promoted** endorsement and made the semantic model discoverable

This repo is part of my Power BI portfolio for recruiters and hiring managers.
